# 🎭 Gender, Age & Emotion Prediction using Deep Learning

This project uses Deep Learning models to predict **Gender**, **Age Group**, and **Emotions** from human facial images. With real-time and static image analysis, the system can assist in applications like smart surveillance, user profiling, emotion-based feedback systems, and more.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 Predicts **Gender**: Male / Female  
- 📊 Estimates **Age Group** from facial features  
- 😊 Detects **Emotions** like Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprise, etc.  
- 📷 Supports both real-time webcam and image uploads  
- 💡 Built using Python, OpenCV, and Keras  

## 📁 Dataset Used

- **UTKFace Dataset** – A large-scale face dataset with age, gender, and ethnicity labels.  
- **FER-2013 Emotion Dataset** – For training the emotion recognition model.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Separate models trained for:  
  - Gender Classification  
  - Age Estimation  
  - Emotion Detection

## 🧪 Sample Output

- ✅ Detected Gender: Female  
- ✅ Estimated Age: 23  
- ✅ Emotion: Happy 😄

## 📊 Results

- **Gender Accuracy**: 95%+  
- **Age MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: ±4 years  
- **Emotion Detection Accuracy**: ~65-70% on test set

## ❓ Why This Project?

In today’s world, understanding human behavior and demographics through facial analysis is becoming increasingly important. This project was developed to:

- Explore the potential of computer vision and deep learning in interpreting human facial features  
- Provide a smart way for machines to estimate gender, age, and emotional states  
- Help businesses, education, healthcare, and marketing sectors with insights into user identity and behavior
